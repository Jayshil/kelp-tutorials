    "WASP-189 is a recent planet observed by CHEOPS as a part of its early science release program. CHEOPS has observed total of 6 of its eclipses, two of them were surrounded by a nice phase modulation, and 4 transits. In a separate set of notebooks, we have analysed four of its transits and six eclipses --- which can be found [here](https://github.com/Jayshil/pycheops-tutorials/tree/main/WASP-189)."
